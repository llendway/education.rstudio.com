Today marks the first day of a week-long celebration called [`#BlackinDataWeek`](https://blkindata.github.io/). Its aim is to amplify Black voices in `#informatics`, `#datascience`, and `#coding` around the world. The goals are to:

1.  Providing community and a support system for Black people in data across the Black diaspora.

2.  Encouraging growth in our professional and academic learning paths.

3.  Elevating the voices and experiences of Black people working in data fields.

Read on to find out more about what events are planned, and how you can engage with [`#BlackinDataWeek`](https://blkindata.github.io/).

## How to engage in `#BlackInDataWeek`

### Day 1, Monday: `#BlackInDataRollCall`

-   If you identify as Black, join in the roll call today by introducing yourself and sharing what you do in data. Include the hashtag [`#BlackInDataRollCall`](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInDataRollCall) and tag [`@BlkInData`](https://twitter.com/BlkInData).

-   If you do not, use today to amplify the voices in the [`#BlackInDataRollCall`](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInDataRollCall) hashtag by following and retweeting!

-   If you haven't already, follow the [`@WeAreRLadies`](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) rotating curator account. This week, [Markia Smith](https://blkindata.github.io/author/markia-smith/) will take over (Nov 16-20th) and [Damilola Alex](https://twitter.com/thedamialex) will be taking over next week (Nov 23-27).

-   You can also follow the [`@miR_community`](https://twitter.com/miR_community) account. [MiR](https://medium.com/@doritolay/introducing-mir-a-community-for-underrepresented-users-of-r-7560def7d861) is a community for underrepresented minority users of R, founded by [Dorris Scott](https://twitter.com/Dorris_Scott) and [Danielle Smalls-Perkins](https://twitter.com/smallperks).

### Day 2, Tuesday: `#BlackInDataJourney`

There are three events on this day, check them out [here](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindatajourney/). Note that there will not be a [`#TidyTuesday`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-17/readme.md) this week in order to create space and engage with the `#BlackInDataViz` hashtag on Twitter.

### Day 3, Wednesday: `#BlackInDataSkills`

A great day filled with [learning-oriented events](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindataskills/), and don't miss the 1-hour [Introduction to R](https://blkindata.github.io/talk/intro2r2020/) with [Dr. A Nayena Blankson](https://twitter.com/DrBlankson).

If you want to dive deeper into the tidyverse, the [MiR Community](https://medium.com/@doritolay/introducing-mir-a-community-for-underrepresented-users-of-r-7560def7d861) recently hosted an hour-long introduction to the [dplyr package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) by [Daryn Ramsden](https://twitter.com/thisisdaryn). You can view the webinar on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlQNyBZ03AY), and view his [slides here](https://thisisdaryn.github.io/MiR_dplyr/overview_dplyr/overview_dplyr_plus.html) ([source files here](https://github.com/MiR-Community/MiR_dplyr)).

### Day 4, Thursday: `#BlackInDataViz`

Again, several great [events and talks](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindataviz/), as well as a [Black In Data Visualisation Challenge](https://blkindata.github.io/talk/datavizdaycomp2020/). The challenge, presented in collaboration with the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/), will "highlight data that shows Black people in a positive light."

### Day 5, Friday: `#BlackInDataJustice`

[Webinars](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindatajustice/) feature timely topics around algorithmic fairness and bias. The [last event](https://blkindata.github.io/talk/codedbias-2020/) is a live viewing/tweeting of [`#CodedBias`](https://www.saltlakefilmsociety.org/comingsoon/coded-bias) in honour of \#BlackinDataJustice hosted by Anna Gifty, [`@itsafronomics`](https://twitter.com/itsafronomics), a researcher interested in data bias and algorithmic fairness.

You can access the screening here: <https://www.saltlakefilmsociety.org/comingsoon/coded-bias>

*(Note: tickets are not free, but you can follow along with the live tweeting without watching.)*

### Day 6, Saturday: `#BlackInDataMentorship`

The final day is all about careers and mentorship. Read more about the events [here](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindatacommunity/).
