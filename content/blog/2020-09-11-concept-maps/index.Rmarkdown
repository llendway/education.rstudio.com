We introduce [concept maps](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory-concept-maps)
as a tool to help people figure out what they're trying to teach
early in the [instructor training course](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k45SqyM-w4DtK7dmedeX7pk_r8B9Aq0FKKCxC04pTRM/).
Over the past few months,
a group of certified instructors have been creating concept maps for re-use
and to serve as examples for people who are trying to draw their own.
We have collected some of these in <https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/> under a Creative Commons license;
we hope you'll find them useful,
and we welcome comments, improvements, and additions.
