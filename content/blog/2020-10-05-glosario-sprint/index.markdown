In July we announced [Glosario][glosario],
an open source, multilingual glossary of data science terms that now contains more than 500 terms in multiple languages.
We hope it will help lesson developers and maintainers make their materials more findable
as well as helping learners directly.

This month,
as part of [Hacktoberfest][hacktoberfest],
we're encouraging all members of our community to help expand Glosario.
So far, it includes definitions in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish,
but it has been designed to include definitions in any language.
We'd love to see our international community come together to provide definitions and translations
to increase the value of this resource for everyone.

You don't need to know any particular programming language to contribute to Glosario:
anyone who is familiar with the GitHub web interface can get involved.
There is a detailed contributors' guide [in the repo][glosario-repo],
and contributions are welcome in **any** language, not only those we already have.
To ensure that your contributions are included in Hacktoberfest
and count towards you planting a tree or receiving a free t-shirt,
remember to register on [the Hacktoberfest website][hacktoberfest].
